Overview:


Create a backend and frontend signal-page applicaiton.  The use of the Ruby on rails and API connection
to get both Front and backend connected.  The Front App that I created as a simple todo list.  With 3 tables
one - many for users to Task to List.

Users stories


Users able to create LIST
Users able to create Task
Only users can see their own list.
User is able to update their list.

Approach:

I started with the front end to get a general layout on where i wanted to
put the list etc and login.  Then i started to do the backend to setup
the users login since that was already built in.  After i planned to finished
the backend frist then complete the front end.




Challenges

  The backend was harder then i thought it would be.  Had to spend alot of hours
  reviewing the labs and get information online etc.

  I finished the backed with one table LIST and was going to stop but decied
  to add a 3rd table.  That was harder then i thought and took more time.

  Getting the server to communicate with the server through ajex was another
  challage since i was not to sure how to use curl etc i did not go through
  all the testing and had to use front in console logs and watching the
  rails server for errors to try to fix issues.

  Time management was hard for me.  I completed early but then thought i had time
  for another table.  I completed the task but was not able to fix the prompt
  form field.

  Another problem is still working late and not gettong sleep, it does affect
  your work and at times unable to work during class time due to it.




Final Thoughts:

  The goal for myself is to always try my best and complete the project.
  I feal i did really good with this project and could of had better time if
  i was able to manage myself more.  A plus is talking with classmates about issues
  help me understand my code and others.
